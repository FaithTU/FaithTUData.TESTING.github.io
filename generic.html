									<h1>My Story</h1>
									<h3>A Lifetime of Creativity and a Love of Learning</h3>
									<p><br />Paulo Coelho once stated, "It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting." <br />
										</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images\stand_picture.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>When I was eleven, I had my first experience working with children. I volunteered at my public library, where I helped with the summer reading program. I enjoyed volunteering at my local library. It started my love of learning and giving back to my community.<br />
									I continued my education by getting an AAS Elementary Education from Haskell Indian Nations. Following this, I attended Emporia State University University with BA in Interdisciplinary Studies. Afterward, I decided to travel abroad, to pursue a Master of Science in Digital Library Management (MSc) from the University of Sheffield.<br />
										
									<br />My first job since graduating college was at Amazonlab123. I needed to catalog over 10,000 digital assets into a digital archive within three months. My skills expanded beyond my role onto digital Asset management tasks, Adobe Creative Cloud, and soft skills. I enjoyed my time there. I felt like made a difference with my daily work, and it was a rewarding experience.<br />
									
									<br />My following job was a Yahoo, which was a fantastic learning experience. It allowed me to learn new subjects, communicate with co-workers, and see how my work improved the lives of our customers. I hustled to understand what I needed to know in my new role and was given new projects weekly.<br />
									
									<br /> I do quite a bit of freelance projects, so one week I will write a blog, and the following week I can complete a photoshop project.<br />
									
									<br />A few weeks ago, I saw a friend post about Avery Smith's 21 Days of Data Challenge to upskill. I've been taking a few courses on Coursera and had a little experience with Python.<br />
									
									<br />Now I have started the Data Career Course. This course has challenged my understanding of data science and data analytics. The approach has led me to take action. I started to build a portfolio, completing a couple of projects, and improving my skill sets. Now, I am living and learning one day at a time.<br />
									
									</p>
								<p>Thank you if you have read this far! I appreciate your dedication. I plan to release upcoming projects, so stay tuned. Please come back soon!</p>
